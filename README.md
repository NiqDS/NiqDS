### Hi there 👋

### My name is Nick and I am slowly but surely learning the ropes and making my first steps in the new career path I have chosen.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Kafka and Airflow within the work environment as well as Python and its many real world applications

### 👯 If any of you learners out there are looking for a partner in crime, I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting real life data projects.
